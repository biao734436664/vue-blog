一个多月前，卤煮读了一篇翻译过来的外国人写的技术博客。此君在博客中将js中的类（构造）继承和原型继承做了一些比较，并且得出了结论：建议诸位在开发是用原型继承。文中提到了各种原型继承的优点，详细的露珠不一一说明介绍了。这篇文章的名字是为什么原型继承很重要，有兴趣的同学可以去看，此文有些深度，值得反复阅读。今天这篇文章也来谈谈js中的继承方式以及它们的优缺点。 类式继承（构造函数） ',\n    content: `<p>DI是Angular的特色功能，而在Angular 2.0的计划中，DI将成为一个独立的模块，参见 https://github.com/angular/di.js 这意味着它也有机会被用于nodejs等技术中，其他前端框架也完全有机会使用它。</p>\n      <h3 id=\"h3-0\">DI简介</h3>\n      <p>对于后端程序员，特别是java、.NET程序员来说，DI是个无须解释的概念，但是对前端程序员则比较陌生，我只简单的说一下DI的概念，然后分析用JS实现DI的原理，DI原理和优点的深入讲解参见 http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%8E%A7%E5%88%B6%E5%8F%8D%E8%BD%AC</p>\n      <p>假设你需要某个对象，你有几种选择？</p>\n      <h4 id=\"h4-1\">方法一、自己创建它。</h4>\n      <p>这是看起来最简单直观的方法，但这只是看起来很美，因为对象的创建有可能很复杂：需要一系列的参数，可能还需要先这样、再那样的一系列初始化操作，甚至可能还需要创建它的相关对象，相关对象还需要创建相关对象的相关对象……你确定你在写代码而不是择毛线吗？一句话，这种方式无法适应复杂的对象，随着对象的复杂化，自己动手丰衣足食已经不再是好的选择。</p>\n      <h4 id=\"h4-2\">方法二、使用者从全局注册表查阅它。</h4>\n      <p>这种方法轻松多了，对象的创建者要自己负责创建自己，然后把自己注册到某个全局注册表中，你需要它的时候，就去注册表中根据名字或者其它的独有信息（比如强类型语言中的类名）查询：obj = globalRegistry.get(objectId)。显然，轻松多了，再也不用管它的初始化参数和初始化流程了，拿来就用。那么，问题在哪里？问题在于它很难被单元测试。我们都知道，全局变量是单元测试中的魔鬼，因为它会让各个“单元”互相耦合在一起，那将是单元测试的噩梦。而globalRegistry就是一个全局变量，并且连累着其中的对象也都变成全局的了。更重要的是：你还不够懒。</p>\n      <h4 id=\"h4-3\">方法三、衣来伸手，饭来张口。</h4>\n      <p>这就是所谓DI了。也就是说，我只要指出我需要哪些对象，然后就有人会把这个对象给我，而这个“人”可能是一个应用框架（Framework），也可能是测试容器（Test Runner），我不会关心它是谁，也不用关心它怎么得到的这个对象。这个“人”，专业的说法叫“容器”，下面我会说到这个容器在Angular中对应哪个概念。</p>\n      <p>而我指出“我需要哪些对象”的方式，也有多种，比如可以直接声明一个属性，或者写个Annotation，或者写个配置文件来声明依赖关系，或者在函数的参数中声明，目前angular所采用的方式是函数的参数形式，和一种变形的Annotation形式来防止minify破坏名称，据说angular 2.0会使用新的语言特性强化annotation的方式。</p>\n      <h3 id=\"h3-4\">JavaScript中实现DI的原理</h3>\n      <p>在JavaScript中实现DI，看起来难，实际上原理很简单，它的核心技术是Function对象的toString()。我们都知道，对一个函数对象执行toString()，它的返回值是函数的源码，知道了这一点，接下来就简单的：我获取了函数源码，然后我对函数的声明进行解析，伪码如下：</p>\n      <pre>\n        <code class=\"javascript\" lang=\"javascript\">\n          var giveMe = function(config) {\n          };\n          var registry = {};\n          var inject = function(func, thisForFunc) {\n          // 获取源码\n          var source = func.toString();\n          // 用正则表达式解析源码\n          var matcher = source.match(/..表达式有些复杂，省略../);\n          // 解析结果是各个参数的名称\n          var objectIds = ….\n          // 查阅出相应的对象，放到数组中准备作为参数传过去\n          var objects = [];\n          for (var i = 0; i < objectIds.length; ++i)\n          objects.push(registry[objectIds[i]]);\n          // 调用这个函数，并且把参数传过去\n          func.apply(thisForFunc || func, objects)\n          };\n          inject(giveMe)\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>当然，一个实际的DI系统需要考虑的问题比这要多很多，但是这段代码用来表现原理应该足够了。</p>\n      <h3 id=\"h3-5\">Angular中的DI</h3>\n      <p>接下来我们再来看Angular中的DI实现：</p>\n      <p>在Angular中，所有主要编程元素都需要通过某种方式注册进去，比如myModule.service(‘serviceName’, function()….这实际上就是把后面这个函数加入到一个容器中，要注意的是：angular全面实现了延迟初始化，也就是说，当这个对象没有被别人需要的时候，它是不会被创建的，这样对于提高性能有一定的帮助，特别是加快了启动速度。</p>\n      <p>这里一个有趣的问题是：Angular的容器是什么。Angular不存在真正的全局对象，所以你可以放心的在同一个页面中放多个app，而不用担心他们互相干扰，但是容器又需要一个众所周知的地方来存放这些“名字和对象”的注册表（Registry），在Angular中，这个注册表就叫做module，所以，现在你应该知道为什么module的地位很重要了吧？不过一个app中可以存在很多不同名字的module，它们之间存在某些依赖关系，而这体现在module的声明语法中：angular.module(‘someModule’, [‘dep1’, ‘dep2])，这样划分module有利于程序的文件组织。</p>\n      <p>根据DI的原理，一个自然的推论就是：被注入的对象通常都是单例，因为创建了一个，就可以始终使用它了，不需要多次创建。因此，如果你需要在angular中跨controller共享数据或者通讯，那么你可以创建一个service/value/constant等，然后把它们分别注入到两个controller中，而这两个controller将自然而然的共享同一个对象。</p>\n
